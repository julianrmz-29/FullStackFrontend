# FullStackFrontend
Fronted to task to do created in React

# NOTES: 
- Frontend to manage the task crud
- Open the project with Visual Studio Code
- Install a library using the following command in the terminal: 'npm install react-router-dom'
- To start the server, enter the command npm start
- Once the project is compiled, a page will open in the browser. Select the To Do List option from the menu. This will display a table with the corresponding data, as well as the option to add new tasks, as well as edit or delete if the table shows data.

For proper operation, you must have the backend compiled. If not, download the code from: https://github.com/julianrmz-29/FullStackBackend.git

Good luck
